### Goals
[Top][]

MediaScape targets applications that provide shared experiences across multiple devices.

This library provides a generic mechanism for timing-sensitive execution of timed data. 

Timed data is data associated with an interval or a point, say (23.2,24.8) or (12.4). The Sequencer is driven by an explicit timing source (not system clock) and its main function is to emit "enter" and "exit" events for timed data, at the correct time (according to its timing source). This way the Sequencer is similar to a HTMLTrackElement. However, unlike the HTMLTrackElement, the Sequencer does not use a HTMLMediaElement as timing source. Instead, the Sequencer uses Shared Motion, a generic, multi-device timing mechanism for the Web. This way, the Sequencer becomes a generic building block for timed execution in multi-device Web applications. The Sequencer also improves upon the HTMLTrackElement in other respects. In particular, the timing of emitted events is much more precise.

### Structure
[Top][]

The generic structure of mediascape repositories is:

  * API: The JavaScript API.
  * complements: additional elements for extra and optional features.
  * helloworld: minimal sample code.
