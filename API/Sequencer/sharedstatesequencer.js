		Shared State Sequencer
		Wrapper around Sequencer to integrate with data, i.e. a storage 
		object implementing a key->value store. If the storage object is
		dynamic, the Sequencer will be able to monitor it's changes and react 
		appropriately. The Sequencer does not modify data in the storage object.

		Storage objects are required to implement the following API.
		This implies that SharedState (MediaScape) may be used directly. 

		value <- storage.getItem(key);
		[key1, key2,..] <- storage.keys();
		// optionally eventing support for dynamic data
	
		storage.on("change", changeHandler(eArgs)); // (key,value) pairs created or modified
		storage.on("remove", removeHandler(eArgs)); // (key,value) pairs removed 

		eArgs = [{key: key, value: value},...]
		for "change" event - eArgs represent new state
		for "remove" event - eArgs represent old state

		"change" event provides immediate event with (list of) current key-value pairs
	
		values are assumed to include properties with float values for defining
		Invervals, or else they will be ignored.
		.start
		.end
		If only one is present it will be used as singularity Interval.
