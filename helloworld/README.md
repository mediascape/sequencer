# Demo Documentation

These are demoes for the Sequencer.

All demoes may be run directly by opening the local file in the browser. 

Open at least ctrl.html and <X>.html in two different tabs/windows.

Open <X>.html in multiple tabs/windows in order to appreciate precise sync. 

You may also verify multi-device sync by opening links on different computers. 

Resources
* js/viewer.js - simplistic viewer used by most demoes to update DOM based on timed sequencer events.
* js/timeddata.js - collection of timeddata resources used by demonstrations.
* js/localstorage.js - sequencer, viewer and editor for timed data persisted and shared using LocalStorage - relevant for dynamic.html
* js/test.js - test code - relevant for test.html
* app.js - main application - loads motion

Demoes
* ctrl.html - all demoes are controlled by the same motion. You may control it by opening ctrl.html.
* index.html is the most basic demonstration of the Sequencer 
* array.html demoes how to sequence and array with timed data using the Sequencer
* special.html demoes how the Sequencer may be specialized to integrate with a specific data format
* minimal.html demoes how timed data, motion, sequencer and viewer may be connected essentially in ONE(!) line of code
* dynamic.html demoes Sequencer support for dynamic changes of timed data. Includes viewer and editor for working with timed data.
* test.html runs some precoded tests
